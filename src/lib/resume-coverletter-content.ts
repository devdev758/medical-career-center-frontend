## Cover Letter Examples for Nurses

### Example 1: New Graduate RN

**Scenario**: Recent BSN graduate applying for first RN position at a teaching hospital

> **Emily Rodriguez, RN, BSN**  
> Dallas, TX 75201  
> (214) 555-0123  
> emily.rodriguez@email.com
>
> January 15, 2026
>
> Hiring Manager  
> Methodist Dallas Medical Center  
> Dallas, TX 75203
>
> Dear Hiring Manager,
>
> I am writing to express my strong interest in the Medical-Surgical Registered Nurse position at Methodist Dallas Medical Center, as advertised on your careers page. As a recent BSN graduate from the University of Texas at Dallas with over 600 clinical hours and current RN licensure, I am eager to begin my nursing career at a facility renowned for its commitment to evidence-based practice and exceptional patient outcomes.
>
> During my senior nursing practicum at Methodist Dallas, I had the privilege of working on your 7th floor medical-surgical unit under the mentorship of Sarah Chen, RN. This experience solidified my desire to join your nursing team. I provided comprehensive care for 6-8 patients per shift, administered over 300 medications with 100% accuracy, and collaborated with your interdisciplinary team. Your unit's emphasis on hourly rounding and patient-centered care aligns perfectly with my nursing philosophy developed throughout my education.
>
> My clinical rotations across medical-surgical, ICU, and pediatric settings have prepared me to handle diverse patient populations and complex situations. At Parkland Hospital's ICU, I gained valuable experience with critically ill patients, ventilator management, and rapid response scenarios. Additionally, my work as a Patient Care Technician at Baylor Scott & White for the past two years has given me hands-on experience with patient care, vital signs monitoring, and working as part of a healthcare team.
>
> I am particularly drawn to Methodist Dallas's Nurse Residency Program and your investment in new graduate development. The structured support and educational opportunities you provide align with my goal of becoming an excellent medical-surgical nurse. I am committed to continuous learning and would thrive in your collaborative, teaching-focused environment.
>

>
> Sincerely,  
> Emily Rodriguez, RN, BSN

- ✓ Quantifies experience (600+ hours, 300+ medications, 6-8 patients)
- ✓ Addresses new grad status positively
- ✓ Shows knowledge of residency program
- ✓ Professional yet warm tone

### Example 2: Specialty Change (Med-Surg to ICU)

**Scenario**: Experienced med-surg nurse transitioning to critical care

> **Michael Chen, RN, BSN, MEDSURG-BC**  
> Houston, TX 77002  
> (832) 555-7890  
> michael.chen.rn@email.com

> January 15, 2026
>
> Sarah Wilson, RN, MSN, Nurse Manager  
> Memorial Hermann – Texas Medical Center  
> Houston, TX 77030
>
> Dear Ms. Wilson,
>
> I am excited to apply for the Medical ICU Registered Nurse position at Memorial Hermann Texas Medical Center. With four years of medical-surgical nursing experience, board certification in medical-surgical nursing (MEDSURG-BC), and recent ACLS certification, I am prepared to transition my skills to critical care and contribute to your renowned ICU team.
>
> My medical-surgical experience has provided a strong foundation for ICU nursing. At Houston Methodist Hospital, I regularly care for high-acuity patients requiring close monitoring, complex medication regimens, and rapid interventions. I have independently managed patients with sepsis, post-operative complications, and multi-system organ dysfunction – experiences that translate directly to ICU care. Additionally, serving as charge nurse 2-3 times weekly has strengthened my crisis management and leadership abilities.
>
> I am particularly drawn to critical care because I thrive in fast-paced environments requiring quick critical thinking and advanced clinical skills. Last year, I successfully completed a critical care shadowing program in your MICU, where I observed ventilator management, CRRT, and hemodynamic monitoring. This experience confirmed my passion for intensive care nursing. To prepare for this transition, I have also completed ACLS certification, enrolled in a hemodynamic monitoring course, and begun studying for the CCRN examination.
>
> Memorial Hermann's commitment to clinical excellence and your comprehensive ICU orientation program make this the ideal environment for my specialty transition. I am eager to bring my strong work ethic, med-surg expertise, and genuine passion for critical care to your team.
>
> I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my experience and dedication to professional growth can benefit your ICU. Thank you for your consideration.
>
> Sincerely,  
> Michael Chen, RN, BSN, MEDSURG-BC

**Why This Works**:
- ✓ Directly addresses specialty change in opening
- ✓ Highlights transferable skills from med-surg to ICU
- ✓ Shows proactive preparation (ACLS, shadowing, hemodynamic course)
- ✓ Demonstrates knowledge of facility's ICU orientation program
- ✓ Specific examples of relevant high-acuity experience

### Example 3: Internal Promotion to Charge Nurse

**Scenario**: Staff nurse applying for charge nurse position at current facility

> **Jennifer Thompson, RN, MSN**  
> San Antonio, TX 78201  
> (210) 555-9012  
> jennifer.thompson.rn@email.com
>
> January 15, 2026
>
> Rebecca Martinez, MSN, RN, Director of Nursing  
> Methodist Hospital Medical-Surgical Unit  
> San Antonio, TX 78201
>
> Dear Ms. Martinez,
>
> I am writing to formally express my interest in the Charge Nurse position for the 7th floor medical-surgical/telemetry unit. Having served as a staff nurse on this unit for the past five years and recently completed my MSN in Nursing Administration, I am ready to take on formal leadership responsibilities and contribute to our unit's continued excellence.
>
> During my time on 7th floor, I have had the privilege of serving as charge nurse approximately 90% of my shifts over the past two years. In this informal leadership role, I have successfully managed staffing assignments, coordinated bed flow, resolved patient and family concerns, and mentored new graduate nurses. Under my preceptorship, our unit has achieved a 92% new hire retention rate, significantly above the hospital average of 75%. Additionally, I co-chaired our unit-based council initiative that reduced hospital-acquired pressure injuries by 60% facility-wide.
>
> My MSN capstone project focused on reducing RN turnover through evidence-based retention strategies – research I have already begun implementing on our unit with positive results. I have also completed training in conflict resolution, budget management, and regulatory compliance in preparation for this role. Most importantly, I have deep knowledge of our unit culture, staff strengths, and operational challenges, allowing me to hit the ground running.
>
> I am passionate about supporting our nursing staff, maintaining our high-quality patient care standards, and fostering the collaborative environment that makes 7th floor special. I would be honored to serve this team in a formal leadership capacity.
>
> Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how I can continue contributing to our unit's success as Charge Nurse.
>
> Sincerely,  
> Jennifer Thompson, RN, MSN

**Why This Works**:
- ✓ Leverages internal knowledge and relationships
- ✓ Quantifies leadership impact (92% retention, 60% pressure injury reduction)
- ✓ Shows proactive preparation (MSN, leadership training)
- ✓ Demonstrates commitment to unit and facility
- ✓ Professional tone despite internal application

>
> Before stepping away to care for family, I worked as a med-surg nurse at Mayo Clinic Hospital for seven years, where I developed strong clinical skills and a reputation for excellent patient care. I maintained my RN license throughout my break and recently completed a comprehensive RN refresher course, ACLS recertification, and Epic EMR training to ensure my skills are current with today's healthcare environment.
>
> During my time away from bedside nursing, I remained connected to healthcare by volunteering as a school nurse and teaching CPR/First Aid classes in my community. These experiences kept my clinical assessment and emergency response skills sharp while allowing me the flexibility I needed during that season of life. Now, with my family situation stabilized, I am ready and eager to return to acute care nursing full-time.
>
> I am drawn to Banner University Medical Center because of your excellent reputation for patient care and your supportive work environment. I am confident that my previous acute care experience, combined with my recent training and genuine enthusiasm for returning to nursing, make me a strong candidate for your team.
>
> I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications and address any questions about my career gap. Thank you for your consideration.

> Lisa Anderson, RN, BSN

- ✓ Addresses career gap directly and honestly
- ✓ Shows proactive skill updating (refresher course, ACLS, Epic training)
