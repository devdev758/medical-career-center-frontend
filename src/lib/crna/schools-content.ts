# Best CRNA Schools 2026: Accredited Nurse Anesthesia Programs

Choosing the right CRNA program is one of the most important decisions in your journey to becoming a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist. With approximately 130 accredited programs nationwide, each offering unique strengths, this guide helps you identify top programs and understand what makes them exceptional.

**Critical**: Only attend programs accredited by the **Council on Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Educational Programs (COA)**. Non-accredited programs do NOT qualify you to sit for the National Certification Examination.

## Understanding CRNA Education Accreditation

### COA Accreditation Requirement

The **Council on Accreditation (COA)** is the specialized accrediting body for nurse anesthesia educational programs.

**Why COA Accreditation Matters**:
- **NCE Eligibility**: Only COA-accredited program graduates can sit for certification exam
- **Quality Assurance**: Programs meet rigorous educational standards
- **Federal Financial Aid**: Required for student loan eligibility
- **State Licensure**: Most states require graduation from COA-accredited program

**Verify Accreditation**: Always check current accreditation status at [www.coacrna.org](https://www.coacrna.org)

### Doctoral Degree Requirement

As of **2022**, all entry-level CRNA programs must award a **doctoral degree**:

**DNP** (Doctor of Nursing Practice) - Most common, 90%+ of programs  
**DNAP** (Doctor of Nurse Anesthesia Practice) - Specialty anesthesia doctorate

Both degrees fully qualify you to practice as a CRNA. There is no difference in scope of practice or salary between DNP and DNAP graduates.

## Online vs. On-Campus CRNA Programs

### Hybrid/Online Didactic Programs

**Advantages**:
- Geographic flexibility
- Maintain current job initially
- Lower relocation costs
- Self-paced learning (within deadlines)

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires high self-discipline
- Less face-to-face faculty interaction
- Clinical rotations still require travel/relocation
- May have less networking with classmates

**Programs Offering Hybrid**:
- Many programs now offer some online didactic components
- Clinical hours still 100% in-person (cannot be online)
- Check accreditation status carefully

### Fully On-Campus Programs

**Advantages**:
- Immersive learning environment
- Immediate faculty access
- Stronger cohort bonding
- Better networking opportunities
- Simulation lab access

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires relocation
- Higher living costs
- Complete career pause
- Less flexibility

**Recommendation**: For most students, on-campus or hybrid programs with strong on-campus components provide best preparation. Clinical anesthesia requires hands-on learning that benefits from in-person instruction.

## Red Flags to Avoid

**⚠️ Non-COA Accredited Programs**: Never attend a non-accredited program  
**⚠️ Declining NCE Pass Rates**: Check 3-year trends, avoid programs with declining rates  
**⚠️ New Programs**: First few cohorts may face growing pains, less established clinical sites  
**⚠️ High Attrition**: >15% attrition rate suggests program issues  
**⚠️ Poor Communication**: If admissions is unresponsive, program likely has issues  
**⚠️ Guaranteed Admission**: Be wary of programs guaranteeing admission without competitive process  
**⚠️ Job Placement**: <90% placement suggests program reputation issues
