## How to Customize Your Template (5-Minute Quick Start)

**Step 1: Choose the right template** for your experience level and career goals (use the "Perfect for" descriptions above).

**Step 2: Open in Microsoft Word** and immediately "Save As" with a new filename (e.g., "YourName_RN_Resume.docx").

**Step 3: Replace all placeholder text** with your specific information:
- Your name, contact info, credentials
- Your actual job titles, facilities, dates
- Your real achievements, certifications, education

**Step 4: Customize bullets** for each position:
- Start with action verbs (Provided, Managed, Improved, Led, Coordinated)
- Include specific numbers (patient ratios, satisfaction scores, cost savings)
- Match keywords from job descriptions you're targeting
- Remove any bullets that don't apply to you

**Step 5: Proofread and format check**:
- Spell check everything (names, facility names, certifications)
- Verify all dates are accurate and consistent
- Ensure formatting is uniform (same font, spacing, bullet style)
- Check that file is still ATS-friendly (no tables, text boxes, or graphics added)

**Step 6: Save as PDF** when submitting (unless the job posting specifically requests .docx format).
