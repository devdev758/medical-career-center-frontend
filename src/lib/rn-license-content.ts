## Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC): Multistate Licensure

The **Enhanced Nurse Licensure Compact (eNLC)** allows RNs to practice in multiple states with ONE multistate license. As of 2024, **43 states and territories** participate in the NLC.

### NLC Compact States (2024)

✅ **43 Participating Jurisdictions**:

Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, **Guam**, **U.S. Virgin Islands**, **Northern Mariana Islands**

❌ **Non-Compact States** (require separate license):
Alaska, California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Puerto Rico

### How the NLC Works

**With Multistate License, You Can**:
✓ Practice physically in ANY compact state
✓ Provide telehealth nursing to patients in ANY compact state
✓ Hold one license instead of 43 separate licenses
✓ Move between compact states without relicensing

**How to Get Multistate License**:
1. **Declare primary state of residence** (must be an NLC compact state)
2. **Meet that state's licensure requirements**
3. **Receive multistate license** (will say "multistate" on license)

**Important**: If you move your primary residence to a different compact state, you must apply for a new license in your new home state within 60 days.

### Who Benefits Most from NLC?
- **Travel nurses** working across multiple states
- **Border residents** who live in one state, work in another
- **Telehealth nurses** providing virtual care
- **Military spouses** who relocate frequently
- **Per diem/PRN nurses** working in multiple states

## Licensure by Endorsement: Transferring Your License

If you already hold an RN license in one state and want to practice in another, you apply for **licensure by endorsement** (also called reciprocity).

### When You Need Endorsement

- Moving from non-compact state to another non-compact state
- Moving from non-compact state to compact state
- Moving your PRIMARY RESIDENCE from one compact state to another
- Licensed internationally and want U.S. license

### Endorsement Requirements (Typical)

✅ **Active, unencumbered RN license** in another U.S. jurisdiction
✅ **Verification of original license** (via Nursys.com or paper verification)
✅ **Graduation from approved nursing program**
✅ **Passed NCLEX-RN** (no need to retake!)
✅ **Criminal background check** and fingerprinting
✅ **Application fees** ($50-$400 depending on state)
✅ **Continuing education** (some states require CEUs even for endorsement)

**Processing Time**: 2-8 weeks typically (can be expedited in some states for additional fee)

### Nursys.com: License Verification System

**Nursys** is the national database for nurse licensure verification. Most states participate, making endorsement faster and easier.

**How Nursys Works**:
1. Create free account at Nursys.com
2. Request license verification
3. Pay small fee ($30-50)
4. Verification sent electronically to new state board

**If your state doesn't use Nursys**: You'll need to request paper verification form from your current state board and mail to new state board.
