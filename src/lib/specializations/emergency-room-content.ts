# ER Nurse: Emergency Department Nursing Career Guide

Emergency Room (ER) Nurses, also called Emergency Department (ED) Nurses, are the front-line healthcare providers who assess, treat, and stabilize patients with acute injuries and illnesses. Working in one of the most fast-paced, unpredictable environments in healthcare, ER nurses must think quickly, multitask effectively, and remain calm under pressure.

## What ER Nurses Do

ER nurses perform rapid patient assessments using triage protocols, prioritizing patients based on acuity. They stabilize trauma victims, manage cardiac emergencies, treat overdoses, care for pediatric and geriatric emergencies, and handle everything from minor lacerations to life-threatening conditions. Unlike floor nurses, ER nurses see patients for hours, not days, requiring quick rapport-building and efficient care delivery.

**Typical Responsibilities:**
- Triage and rapid assessment of incoming patients
- Start IVs, draw blood, administer medications
- Wound care, splinting, suturing assistance
- EKG interpretation and cardiac monitoring
- Trauma resuscitation and code blues
- Patient and family education
- Collaboration with physicians, techs, and specialists

## Salary & Compensation

**Average Salary**: $75,000 - $105,000 annually  
**Entry-Level**: $65,000 - $75,000  
**Experienced (5+ years)**: $85,000 - $115,000  
**Level I Trauma Centers**: Often 10-20% higher than community EDs

ER nurses typically earn more than medical-surgical nurses but slightly less than ICU nurses. Shift differentials for nights, weekends, and holidays can add $5,000-$15,000 annually. Many Level I trauma centers offer additional hazard pay or specialty pay.

## Work Environment & Schedule

**Settings**: Hospital emergency departments (community, academic medical centers, Level I-III trauma centers), urgent care centers, freestanding EDs

**Typical Schedule**:
- 12-hour shifts (day, evening, or night)
- Rotating schedules common
- Every other weekend or every third weekend
- Major holidays typically included in rotation

**Patient Volume**: Varies dramatically - can see 4-8+ patients simultaneously depending on acuity and department size

**Environment**: Loud, chaotic, unpredictable. No two shifts are alike.

## Requirements & Certifications

**Minimum Requirements:**
- Active RN license
- BLS (Basic Life Support) certification
- ACLS (Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support) **required**
- PALS (Pediatric Advanced Life Support) often required
- TNCC or ENPC for trauma-focused EDs

**Specialty Certification:**
- **CEN (Certified Emergency Nurse)** - The ER specialty certification
  - Requires 2 years of ER experience
  - Demonstrates ER competency
  - Often includes pay increase ($1-3/hour)

**New Grad Friendly**: Many EDs offer new graduate residency programs (3-6 months orientation)

## Skills Required

**Clinical S kills:**
- Rapid assessment and triage
- IV insertion (often difficult sticks)

## Career Path

**New Grad RN → ER Nurse** (via ED residency programs)
