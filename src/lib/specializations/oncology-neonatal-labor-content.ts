Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Nurses specialize in caring for premature and critically ill newborns. Working with the smallest, most vulnerable patients, NICU nurses combine advanced critical care skills with the gentleness required for fragile infants, while supporting families through the emotional rollercoaster of having a baby in intensive care.

## What NICU Nurses Do

NICU nurses care for premature infants (born before 37 weeks), babies with birth defects, infants with infections or respiratory distress, and newborns requiring surgery. They monitor tiny patients on ventilators, manage feeding tubes, administer specialized medications, provide developmental care, and teach parents how to care for their high-needs infants before discharge.

- Level I: Basic well-newborn care
- Level II: Special care for moderately ill infants
- Level III: Intensive care for very sick infants
- Level IV: Highest level, includes surgical capabilities

**Key Skills**: Tiny IV insertion, ventilator management for neonates, gavage feeding, developmental care, family-centered care, kangaroo care, thermoregulation

**Patience Required**: NICU babies may be hospitalized for months; progress is slow and setbacks common

## Career Path

NICU nurses often advance to NICU Charge Nurse, NICU Educator, Transport Nurse (neonatal), or Neonatal Nurse Practitioner (NNP). Some transition to well-baby nursery for less acuity or Labor & Delivery.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**: Rewarding to see tiny babies thrive, technological focus appeals to many, strong teamwork, lower patient ratios, babies can't complain verbally

**Cons**: Emotionally difficult (infant deaths, congenital anomalies), parents often stressed and difficult, tiny procedures are challenging, long hospitalizations, can feel repetitive
