# Pediatric Nurse: Caring for Infants, Children & Adolescents

Pediatric Nurses specialize in providing healthcare to patients from birth through adolescence (typically age 18-21). Unlike adult nurses, pediatric nurses must understand child development, communicate effectively with both children and parents, and administer age-appropriate care across dramatically different sizes and developmental stages.

## What Pediatric Nurses Do

Pediatric nurses care for children in hospitals, clinics, schools, and specialty settings. They perform age-appropriate assessments, administer medications using weight-based dosing, provide immunizations, manage chronic conditions like asthma and diabetes, and support families through childhood illnesses and injuries. A key aspect is family-centered care, recognizing that treating the child means partnering with the family.

**Common Conditions Treated:**
- Respiratory infections and asthma
- Injuries and accidents
- Diabetes and chronic conditions
- Congenital disorders
- Infectious diseases
- Developmental delays
- Mental health concerns in adolescents

## Salary & Compensation

**Average Salary**: $70,000 - $95,000 annually  
**Entry-Level**: $60,000 - $70,000  
**Experienced (5+ years)**: $75,000 - $100,000  
**Specialty Pediatrics** (PICU, Pediatric Oncology): $80,000 - $110,000

Pediatric nurses in outpatient settings typically earn less than those in acute care hospitals. Pediatric ICU nurses and those in specialty areas like oncology or cardiology earn premium salaries.
