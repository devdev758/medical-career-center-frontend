## Top 10 New Graduate Resume Tips

### 1. **Lead with Education**

As a new grad, your BSN/ADN is your strongest qualification. List education before work experience.

Include: School name, degree, graduation date, GPA (if 3.5+), honors (summa cum laude, dean's list), scholarships.

### 2. **List All Certifications Prominently**

Create a certifications section right after your objective/summary.

Must include: RN license with state and number, BLS, ACLS (if you have it), PALS (if applying to peds)

Format: "Registered Nurse (RN), Texas Board of Nursing, License #987654, Active"

### 3. **Use a Professional Objective (Not Summary)**

New grads benefit from objective statements that express enthusiasm and career goals.

❌ **Generic**: "Seeking a challenging nursing position to utilize my skills"

✅ **Specific**: "Compassionate BSN graduate with 600+ clinical hours across med-surg, ICU, and pediatrics seeking to apply evidence-based nursing practices in acute care at Memorial Hermann Medical Center"

### 4. **Format Clinical Rotations Like Jobs**

Use job-style formatting: rotation name as title, facility/location, dates, bullet points of achievements.

Each rotation should have 3-5 specific bullets highlighting what you did and learned.

### 5. **Quantify Everything**

Numbers make your experience real and measurable.

Count: Clinical hours, patients cared for, medications administered, procedures performed, shifts completed, teams collaborated with.

### 6. **Include Relevant Non-Nursing Work**

CNA, Patient Care Tech, Medical Assistant, EMT experience is highly relevant - include it!

Even retail or food service jobs show work ethic, customer service, and teamwork.

### 7. **Keep It to One Page**

Hiring managers spend 6-7 seconds on initial resume scan. One page, well-formatted, is optimal for new grads.

Only go to two pages if you have extensive healthcare work experience (2+ years as CNA/PCT).

### 8. **Use ATS-Friendly Formatting**

70% of resumes are screened by Applicant Tracking Systems before human eyes see them.

Use simple fonts (Arial, Calibri), avoid tables and text boxes, use standard section headers, save as .docx or PDF.

### 9. **Tailor Your Objective for Each Application**

Customize your objective statement to mention the specific facility and unit when possible.

Research the hospital's mission/values and reference them if appropriate.

### 10. **Proofread Obsessively**

A single typo can disqualify you. Proofread 3+ times, use spell check, have someone else review it.

Pay special attention to: Hospital names, certification names/numbers, dates (format consistently), contact information.
